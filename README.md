> A generator to create a phoenix application using React as view

## Features
- End to end testing with [hound](https://github.com/HashNuke/hound)
- Unit Testing with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io), [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [chai](http://chaijs.com/)
- Ecmascript 2015

## Installation
First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-phoenix-react using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-phoenix-react
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo phoenix-react <my-project-name>
```

## Testing
Tests can be divided into three groups.
1. React unit tests
2. Phoenix unit tests
3. Phoenix E2E tests

### Running tests
Make sure to have a web driver running.

```bash
# Run the entire test suite
bin/test

# OR start the web driver manually and run the entire suite
# Make sure to start the web driver
chromedriver # default configured for hound
npm run-script build && mix test --include feature

# Run the tests for react components only
npm test
# or
npm run-script test:watch # for TDD

# Run the elixir unit tests only (Fastest)
mix test --exclude feature --exclude integration
```

### Use a different web driver for E2E testing

```elixir
# config/test.exs
# Replace this line with a different configuration that can be found at
# https://github.com/HashNuke/hound/blob/master/notes/configuring-hound.md
config :hound, driver: "phantomjs"
```

**NOTE:** Make sure to change `bin/test` to start this web driver instead.

### React component test example

```javascript
// test/static/js/app.spec.js
import React from 'react';
import {expect} from 'chai';
/**
* <my-project> is replaced by your project name which can be found under "resolve.alias" in
* webpack.config.js in the root of this project
*/
import App from '<my_project>/components/app';
import {render} from 'test_helpers';


describe('App', () => {
  it ('renders html', () => {
    let output = render(<App />);
    expect(output.props.children).to.have.length.above(0);
  });
});
```

## Getting To Know Yeoman
Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced. Feel free to [learn more about him](http://yeoman.io/).
